Hello. My name is Hrvoje Stojic. 

I'm currently a post-doctoral researcher at [University College London](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/Dolan/). In my research I focus on how people learn about the world and use their models of the world to make good decisions. My hope is that this work will help us understand the cognitive processes behind people's learning and decision making a bit better. I also hope it will allow us bring scientific insights closer to the real world, predicting behaviour in the wild - from making everyday choices in supermarkets to making choices with long ranging consequences on stock markets. Beyond these topics, I'm interested in "deciding how to decide" problem, that is, how do people choose which choice strategy to apply and when, as well as other meta-level questions, such as how do people so easily transfer knowledge from one domain to another. The econ side of me is also interested in markets - aggregate choice outcomes and dynamics when many individual agents interact. Finally, owing to my formal modelling approach to every problem, I have a keen interest in methods and latest developments in algorithms for learning and decision making.

This is my personal website. I am experimenting with the blog for keeping notes about ideas, research, and sharing my excitement with science. I will be happy if anyone else finds these discussions useful.

## Bio

I was born and grew up in Croatia. I got my undergraduate degrees, one in Economics and another in Psychology, at the <a href="http://www.unizg.hr/homepage/about-university/">University of Zagreb</a>. After a short career as a market research analyst at <a href="http://www.ipsosadria.com/">IPSOS Adria</a>, I did a PhD in Economics at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](http://www.upf.edu/) in Barcelona, under the supervision of [Robin M. Hogarth](http://www.econ.upf.edu/~hogarth/Robin_M._Hogarth/Home.html).

Source code for the blog can be found at [Github](https://github.com/hstojic/hstojic.github.io). I have used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) with a slightly modified Minima theme. I am using great fonts developed by Rasmus Anderson - [Interface](https://rsms.me/interface/), and Pandoc flavour of markdown, via [jekyll-pandoc](https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-pandoc) plugin. -->
