Welcome to my personal website! 

I'm a decision making researcher, equipped with love for learning and growth, and a near-limitless dose of optimism. I am passionate about making an impact on human condition by applying advanced decision making methods to tackle challenging real-world problems.

Currently I'm a Research Scientist at [Secondmind](https://www.secondmind.ai/) (previously known as Prowler.io), mostly working on improving efficiency of industrial production processes through a liberal application of Bayesian optimization and Active learning methods. Check our open-source toolbox [Trieste](https://github.com/secondmind-labs/trieste), a research-friendly and production-ready TensorFlow-backed framework for Bayesian optimization, that I'm helping build and maintain.
 
I obtained a PhD in Economics from [Pompeu Fabra University](https://www.upf.edu/web/econ), where, under supervision of [Prof. Robin M. Hogarth](http://www.econ.upf.edu/~hogarth/Robin_M._Hogarth/Home.html), I worked on understanding human learning and decision-making, using probabilistic modelling and reinforcement learning methods. After that I moved to [University College London](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/) where under supervision of Prof. Ray Dolan and Prof. Peter Dayan I studied human generalisation and function learning, and probed interactions between learning, choice and attention processes, again through the lens of probabilistic models and reinforcement learning.

<!-- This is my personal website. I am experimenting with the blog for keeping notes about ideas, research, and sharing my excitement with science. I haven't used it much so far, but I hope you will find useful what is there.

## This site

Source code for the blog can be found at [Github](https://github.com/hstojic/hstojic.github.io). I have used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) with a slightly modified Minima theme. I am using fonts developed by Rasmus Anderson - [Interface](https://rsms.me/interface/), and Pandoc flavour of markdown, via [jekyll-pandoc](https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-pandoc) plugin.
