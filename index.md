Welcome to my personal website! 

I'm a Research Scientist at [Secondmind (previously known as Prowler.io)](https://www.secondmind.ai/). My mission is to improve our understanding of intelligence. In my research I focus on decision making, learning and generalization - in my opinion key faculties of intelligent agents, both human and artificial.

I obtained a PhD in Economics from [Pompeu Fabra University](https://www.upf.edu/web/econ), where, under supervision of [Prof. Robin M. Hogarth](http://www.econ.upf.edu/~hogarth/Robin_M._Hogarth/Home.html), I worked on understanding human learning and decision-making, using probabilistic modelling and reinforcement learning. After that I moved to [University College London](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/) where under supervision of Prof. Ray Dolan and Prof. Peter Dayan I studied human generalisation and function learning, and probed interactions between learning, choice and attention processes. Currently, at [Secondmind](https://www.secondmind.ai/), I'm developing new Bayesian optimization and model-based reinforcement learning algorithms, implementing them in our open-source toolboxes ([Trieste](https://github.com/secondmind-labs/trieste)) and [Bellman](https://github.com/Bellman-devs/bellman), and applying them to real-world problems.

Check my [research]({% link _pages/research.md %}) section for publications, code and other details on my research projects. In [teaching]({% link _pages/teaching.md %}) section you can find overview of my teaching, links to materials and other goodies.  

<!-- This is my personal website. I am experimenting with the blog for keeping notes about ideas, research, and sharing my excitement with science. I haven't used it much so far, but I hope you will find useful what is there.

## This site

Source code for the blog can be found at [Github](https://github.com/hstojic/hstojic.github.io). I have used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) with a slightly modified Minima theme. I am using fonts developed by Rasmus Anderson - [Interface](https://rsms.me/interface/), and Pandoc flavour of markdown, via [jekyll-pandoc](https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-pandoc) plugin.
