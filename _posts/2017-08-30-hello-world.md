description: My first blog post! Some bits and pieces about me, and what is the purpose of the blog.

My name is Hrvoje Stojic. Broadly speaking I might be described as a cognitive scientist. But I do my best to resist classifications, for better or for worse. My PhD at [UPF](https://www.upf.edu/en/) was officially in economics, whereas most of my work ended up being in cognitive psychology; with a smaller part dedicated to topics in economics and management. I was conducting a lot of behavioural experiments, studying human learning and decision making processes. However, in making sense of human behaviour I was relying a lot on methods from machine learning and artificial intelligence, to the extent that I ended up being a lecturer in a [Master of Data Science program](http://www.barcelonagse.eu/study/masters-programs/data-science) at Barcelona Graduate School of Economics. Finally, at the moment I am a research associate in [Ray Dolan's lab](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/Dolan/) at University College London, where my role can be best described as a computational neuroscientist. What box should I tick then?

Anyhow, modernizing the website that I have used during my PhD has been on my to do list for quite some time. It was a very basic website cobbled up of couple of html files. For the version 2.0, I thought of experimenting with a blog. At the moment my plan is to use it as a way to keep various notes about research, ideas, programming, and AI, as well as any other random topic that crosses my mind. Let's see how it goes!  

**P.S.** Source code for the blog can be found at [Github](https://github.com/hstojic/hstojic.github.io). I have used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) with slighlty modified Minima theme. I am using great fonts developed by Rasmus Anderson - [Interface](https://rsms.me/interface/), and Pandoc flavour of markdown, via [jekyll-pandoc](https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-pandoc) plugin. 

**P.S.2** Many thanks to Nikolina, Thomas and Pantelis for advices how to improve my new website!
