My research revolves around human learning and decision making. In particular, I've worked on integrating function learning with decision making and strategy selection problem, popularly called a "deciding how to decide" problem. On theoretical side, I often approach these topics from a reinforcement learning perspective and rely a lot on methods developed in machine learning. On empirical side, I usually conduct experiments, collecting behavioural data to test the predictions and the models, often leveraging online labour markets like Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Since recently, I have also started collecting eye-tracking and neuroimaging data alongside the behavioral data. I'm quite excited to be in this area of research. It's a truly interdisciplinary topic, and significant developments are happening all over the place -- from economics and psychology, over biology and neuroscience, to machine learning and artificial intelligence.

I'm an open science proponent. To contribute to reproducible science I strive to make all the research output publicly available, from the data to the code used for modelling and analysis. I'm trying to spread these practices more widely as a reviewer, by asking authors to publish the code and the data - I have signed the [Peer Reviewers' Openness Initiative](https://opennessinitiative.org/). Whenever possible, I preregister my studies, to help reducing the rate of false positives that plagues science.
