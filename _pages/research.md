My research revolves around human learning and decision making. In particular, I've worked on strategy selection problem, popularly called a "deciding how to decide" problem, and on integrating function learning with decision making. On theoretical side, I often approach these topics from a reinforcement learning perspective and rely a lot on methods developed in machine learning. On empirical side, I usually conduct experiments, collecting behavioural (and soon neuroimaging) data to test the predictions and the models. I'm quite excited to be in this area of research. It's a truly interdisciplinary topic, and significant developments are happening all over the place -- from economics and psychology, over biology and neuroscience, to machine learning and artificial intelligence.

I'm an open science proponent. Publishing business is intolerable, with companies cheating governments into paying multiple times for the same product, so I aim to publish in open access journals. To contribute to reproducible science I aim to make all the research output publicly available, from the data to the code used for modelling and analysis. I'm trying to spread these practices more widely by asking authors to publish the code and the data as a reviewer - I have signed the [Peer Reviewers' Openness Initiative](https://opennessinitiative.org/). Whenever possible, I will preregister my studies, to help reducing the rate of false positives that plagues science. 

Regarding the code, most of it is in R,  and somewhat less in Python, JavaScript, and Bourne shell. Sometimes you will find scripts in C++ and Matlab.
